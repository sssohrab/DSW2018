# DSW2018

This repository contains Python codes to reproduce the results of the paper "Vector compression for similarity search using
multi-layer Sparse Ternary Codes" at the [IEEE Data Science Workshop 2018](https://2018.ieeedatascience.org/). 

To run the code, you will need to install the ["sparse_ternary_networks" package](https://github.com/sssohrab/sparse_ternary_networks).
