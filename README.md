# DSW2018

This repository contains Python codes to reproduce the results of the paper "VECTOR COMPRESSION FOR SIMILARITY SEARCH USING
MULTI-LAYER SPARSE TERNARY CODES" to the IEEE Data Science Workshop 2018. 

To run the code, you will need to install the ["sparse_ternary_networks" package](https://github.com/sssohrab/sparse_ternary_network).
